        <h2>Love is the essence of universe. Nothing is comparable to this. Humans behave
accordingly their love quotient. Love has to be pure, without any redemption and
without any indemnity. There are some times when some things only need love to
make up damages. Love is the king of the solitude and swing its full spectra of colors
when you become its prey. It connects you to a world of critical admiration and
criticism. You become laughing stroke for other when it fully furnish your inner with its
timeless unique blend of emotions and sense of vindication.
Hate is sometimes stronger and more rigid in nature than love. Its not essence of
anything but only of self righteousness. Some people are handy for love and others
are handy at hate.
Sometimes hate creates more beautiful results than love. Its is so power full flare that
you don't need solitude or gathering around you. It shows itself , out of control. Person
in hate is often more creative and impulsive than a person in love.
But whether it is love or hate, it consumes you completely. Thousands of millions
people have been playing games of love and hate and no one could stand out of it.
Drastic is that you never know you are self indulging in it.</h2>

        <h2>"How is it possible?? "
I asked in an unusual shallow accent.
"How is it possible that a sensory human being can snatch it's own breaths to
terminate life string? "
I stared as if I was pleading for answer.
" Freedom, my dear..! Liberty, individuality, right of expression."
He pulled out his eyelids while scrounging through every word. As if he was going to
ascend up a cliff.
" How you can find freedom or liberty through ending your life? "
" you are born to fight against whatever hurdle finds you in life. Aren't you? "
" Off coarse! My dear! This is the height of humanity to single out yourself from
others by winning what looked impossible once. "
That was once again confirmation of belief that I can never understand that person.
" How suicide can give you freedom....? "
I asked when he was going to fade away from the scene.
" oh! It can. Absolutely can! Try to remember occasions when you get fed up of life.
You deem there is no purpose of your living around. You just want to run away of
everything, every single relation, knot, breath make you ache. You just want to run
away. You want your soul set free. "
I was wondering how he can read my mind. How he know about my thinking.
" how you know what I think some times? " I asked.
" I did not talk about you. It is human nature. Every human being thinks like this in
life when he gets fed up of normality.
So some people run away, some stay and fight and rest just commit suicide.!"
"what about you? Have you ran away or what? "
I asked him directly steeping in his glittering eyes.
" it's a long story dear! Long story. "</h2>

        <h2>A Resolution is some promise, oath, or future practice you tend to act upon
in future to make yourself and your life better than how it is now!
People make resolutions on special occasions, some resolute on Birth days, some on
New Year, some on Wedding day :) People make resolutions, they forget what they
have resolute. Resolutions sometimes serve as guiding star in hot dessert for a thirst
wrenched person who would have lost life if there was not hope of oasis.
Like every other human phenomenon, resolutions also tend to vary, sometimes fade
away as time passes. People again go on what they were doing before and forget
every resolution!
While some fraction of people, determinate on what they have resolute and hence go
forward in the race of life leaving others behind.
How You can make Your resolutions Work!!
1: Write it down!
Writing down your resolutions on a piece of paper and hanging it somewhere you
glance at least 10 times a day can actually work. Behavioral Scientists examined that
looking several times at your Goal sends your brain signal of Valour and
Determination.
2: Be Show Off!
Surprised!!
You must be!
A non acutomed habit of showing of can actually work.
Being morally show off of what you have set as your goal make it
easier to stick that goal and it builds some sort of social pressure on your nerves to be
what you were bragging about.</h2>

        <h2>Do you like Science Fiction?"
I asked him to gauge his reaction.
Because he had never been seemed interested any type of Fiction. He always talked
about Reality, sad reality, depressing realities, I ever wonder why he is ever gloomy all
the times. Why does he never appear happy!
He rose his head systematically as if struggling with some internal devil and defeating
him.
"Entertainment! Boy, Entertainment! "
" Its all about entertainment.
Man has been born this this way.
Ever since this world has been created!
Man always strived for sources of entertainment.
Entertainment has always been secondary need. When hunger has been crunched and
thirst has been quenched, Man searches through its appetite of entertainment hence
try to discover and create ways to satisfy within.
Sometimes It entertains itself by slaughtering innocent lives.
Sometimes It entertains itself by soothing innocent lives.
Sometimes man finds entertainment and recreation in celebrations and sometimes
finds in Sorrow and solitude. "
" And later one is the case with me. "
" Its just like this and will always be. "</h2>
